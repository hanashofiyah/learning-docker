3. Create Dockerfile to build and run your golang project
    ![image](https://github.com/hanashofiyah/learning-docker/assets/104729134/5ec3da9c-79e2-476d-b721-100f631bf19c)
  
4. Create docker-compose.yml and instruct to run 2 containers

    - Golang Project (give name: "go_service"), expose container port 78 to host port 9911
  ![image](https://github.com/hanashofiyah/learning-docker/assets/104729134/1c26435f-e3f3-4f4c-bcb0-28e821e6b1ae)
    - Postgres image postgres:latest (give name: "database")

    Command for make container : **docker compose up**
    **Result from container in Docker Dekstop**

5. Make sure the golang project can connect to postgresql and postgresql data is persistent
    - network name="netwwc" and volume name = "volwwc‚Äù

6. Run Docker compose with name "my-wise-word-compose"
   ![image](https://github.com/hanashofiyah/learning-docker/assets/104729134/d7f05cc6-7261-4bb0-8e13-a8fa4ec80934)

    - Make sure you can access http://localhost:9911 and show a wise word
   ![image](https://github.com/hanashofiyah/learning-docker/assets/104729134/aa6448cc-4d14-4216-9e1c-bdf016bb9f18)

    - Make sure you can access http://localhost:9911/ping and show Success (with success ping to database) and new data inserted in your     database

8. Check logs of your each container in "my-wise-word-compose"
   **go-service**
